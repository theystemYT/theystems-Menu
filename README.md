# theystem's Menu

**theystem's Menu** is a **basic Roblox script menu** designed to enhance gameplay with a few essential mods. Built with **Rayfield Library**, this menu provides a simple and easy-to-use interface.  
To use theystem's Menu, copy this script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theystemYT/theystems-Menu/refs/heads/main/theystem's%20Menu.lua"))()
```
If the script doesn't work, try this one:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theystemYT/theystems-Menu/refs/heads/main/theystem's%20Menu.lua",true))()
```
# Features of theystem's Menu
- **Scripts Tab**: The scripts tab has scripts for different types of games and Universal scripts.  
- **Interface Settings**: Allows you to destroy the UI.
- **Credits**: Has buttons that allows you to copy the links for my accounts to reach me.
- **Contributions**: Allows you to send requests in Google Forms by getting the link though the button in the script and sending a request for something you want in theystem's Menu.
- **Supported Games**: If you are in a supported game, a new tab will be made with a checkmark icon and the game name. If you click on it, you can find scripts for the game. These is currently only one game supported which is [[FPS] Gun Grounds FFA](https://www.roblox.com/games/12137249458/FPS-Gun-Grounds-FFA). However though, more games are coming soon, so just wait patiently.
# Notes

- This is a **basic menu**, so there are not many mods available yet. (More mods are coming soon.)  
- Some scripts may not work on all games.  
- The script is free to use.  
- And the menu is coded by [ChatGPT.](chatgpt.com)
- Also, before an update, we test the script before updating to confirm it works. So trust me, the script will always work.
But if it doesn't work, don't worry! A patch will be coming soon.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that this script may not work for all executors. It has only been tested with Delta Executor and KRNL executor and they work just fine on those executors.
