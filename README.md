# theystem's Menu

**theystem's Menu** is a **Roblox script menu** designed to enhance gameplay with a few essential stuff. Built with **Rayfield Library**, this menu provides a simple and easy-to-use interface.  
To use theystem's Menu, copy this script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theystemYT/theystems-Menu/refs/heads/main/theystem's%20Menu.lua"))()
```
If the script doesn't work, try this one:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theystemYT/theystems-Menu/refs/heads/main/theystem's%20Menu.lua",true))()
```
# Features of theystem's Menu
- **Universal Scripts**: Has Universal scripts that work in most games. Also has scripts for certain games due to the supported games feature doesn't work on those types of games. More info about that is in the note below the image example for the supported games feature.
- **UI Settings**: Allows you to destroy the UI and change the UI's theme. Also allows you to load your Rayfield Configuration.
- **Credits**: Has buttons that allows you to copy the links for my accounts to reach me.
- **Contributions**: Allows you to send requests in Google Forms by getting the link though the button in the script and sending a request for something you want in theystem's Menu.
> [!NOTE]
>I also recommend to send the code for the feature if you know how to make it.

**Supported Games**: If you are in a supported game, a new tab will be made with a checkmark icon and the game name. If you click on it, you can find scripts for the game.
Here is an example:

>[!NOTE]
>The reason why not all games have supported games tabs and the scripts for those games are in the Universal scripts tab is because some of these supported game tabs don't work. When you join a broken supported game, the tab doesn't show. So, that's why we have been doing this. There are some games that still have supported games tabs, but note, they may break soon.

# Notes

- Some scripts may not work on all games.  
- The script is free to use.  
- The menu is coded by [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com).
- Also, before an update, we test the script before updating to confirm it works. So trust me, the script will always work.
But if it doesn't work, don't worry! A patch will be coming soon.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that this script may not work for all executors. It has only been tested with Delta Executor and KRNL executor and they work just fine on those executors. You can also execute this script on Fluxus too. (More executors will be added here if they can execute this script)
