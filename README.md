# theystem's Menu

**theystem's Menu** is a **basic Roblox script menu** designed to enhance gameplay with a few essential mods. Built with **Rayfield Library**, this menu provides a simple and easy-to-use interface.  
To use theystem's Menu, copy this script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theystemYT/theystems-Menu/refs/heads/main/theystem's%20Menu.lua"))()
```
If the script doesn't work, try this one:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theystemYT/theystems-Menu/refs/heads/main/theystem's%20Menu.lua",true))()
```
